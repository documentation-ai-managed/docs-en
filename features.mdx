## Search and Content Discovery

En's search indexes all your docs, supporting full-text queries, filters, and highlights.

<Expandable title="Advanced Search Filters" default-open="true">
  Filter by tags, spaces, or date. For example, search `API {endpoint}` to find all API-related pages.
</Expandable>

| Feature | Description | Example Query |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Full-text | Matches across titles and body | `authentication flow` |
| Filters | Narrow by space or tag | `tag:api space:project` |
| Highlights | Shows context snippets | `<100ms response` |

## Version Control for Docs

Track every change with Git-like version history. You compare diffs, revert commits, and branch for experiments.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,UI">
  ```bash
  # Pull latest changes
  en pull

  # Create a new version branch
  en branch new-feature-docs

  # Commit changes
  en commit -m "Add authentication guide"
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Programmatic API example
  const en = require('en-docs-sdk');

  await en.checkout('main');
  await en.commit('Update features', { files: ['features.mdx'] });
  ```
