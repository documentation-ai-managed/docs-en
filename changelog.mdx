````javascript
// Old way
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/docs', {
  headers: { 'API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY' }
});

// New way
const token = await getJWTToken();
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/docs', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
````
````python
# Old way
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/docs', headers={'API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'})

# New way
import requests
token = get_jwt_token()
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/v1/docs', headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'})
````
